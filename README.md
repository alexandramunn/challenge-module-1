# Moudle 1 Challenge

## Description
This project was created to refactor the given HTML code and consolidate the CSS style sheet. In doing so the webpage will be more accessible for the client and their users as well as the code being easier to read for other developers. The main goal was to leave the code cleaner than when first examined. By adding HTML attributes I was able to make the site accesible to more users. Through consolidating the CSS and adding comments it's now in a more consise and readable arrangment. 

## Installation
